Participants alive at trial close-out were informed of the transfer to centralized follow-up, and could request/refuse continued follow-up. In the absence of participant contact, the re-consent outcome was determined by default. The default outcome varied by study center. Active: Transferred to centralized follow-up, including continued contact, state registry query and National Death Index (NDI) search. Passive: No active contact, but allows for state registry query and NDI search. Lost: Lost to follow-up and not known dead before re-consent. Considered passive at the time of reconsent. Refused: Declined further follow-up. Confirmed/Presumed Dead: Death prior to opportunity to re-consent.",
